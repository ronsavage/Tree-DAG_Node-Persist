[V 1.05]
Date=2011-03-16T11:52:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No code changes. No need to upgrade.
- Add scripts/create.table.pl, to make it easy to create the 'trees' table.
- Run with -h to get help, especially regarding $DBI_DSN, $DBI_USER, $DBI_PASS.
- Run with -dsn, -extra_columns, -password, -table_name and -username to use another options.
- Add Tree::DAG_Node::Persist::Create for use by scripts/create.table.pl and t/test.t.
- Note: Both these programs default to using the same 3 env vars. However, for t/test.t, if
$DBI_DSN is empty, it uses File::Temp and a DSN of dbi:SQLite:dbname=$temp_file_name.

[V 1.03]
Date=2010-10-25T11:14:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Extend write() method to accept an optional arrayref of extra fields to be written to the
db. The field names are in the call to write(), and the field values are taken from the
attributes of the node.
- Note: The field 'id' is automatically written to the db, when write() is called, so
there is no need to include it in the arrayref.
- Extend read() method likewise to recover this extra data.
- Note: The field 'id' is automatically put in the node's attributes, when read() is called,
so there is no need to include it in the arrayref.
- Enhance t/test.t to match. See usage of $extra, and where $target = 1011.
- Add README to MANIFEST.

AutoCommit => 1}.

[V 1.01]
Date=2010-10-07T08:57:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Add EXLOCK => 0 to the options used by File::Temp in t/test.t. Thanx to Slaven Rezic for
help with this.
- Clarify discussion of id field in attributes hash. Detail: Mention that nodes have ids only
after being written to the database and read back in, so that people don't think the module
generates ids.
- Add a new section to the POD: Machine-Readable Change Log, as part of my new policy to
promote Module::Metadata::Changes.
- Add print statements to Build.PL and Makefile.PL explaining the usage of env vars to
influence t/test.t, if you don't want the default behaviour of using DBD::SQLite. This is
already noted in the FAQ.
