Comments= <<EOT
- Add EXLOCK => 0 to the options used by File::Temp in t/test.t. Thanx to Slaven Rezic for help with this.
- Clarify discussion of id field in attributes hash. Detail: Mention that nodes have ids only after
being written to the database and read back in so that people don't think the module generates ids.
- Add a new section to the POD: Machine-Readable Change Log as part of my new policy to promote
Module::Metadata::Changes.
- Add print statements to Build.PL and Makefile.PL explaining the usage of env vars to influence
t/test.t if you don't want the default behaviour of using DBD::SQLite. This is already noted in the FAQ.
