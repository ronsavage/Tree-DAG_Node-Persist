Revision history for Perl extension Tree:DAG_Node::Persist.

1.08  Wed Feb 18 11:11:00 2015
	- Add repository: https://github.com/ronsavage/Tree-DAG_Node-Persist.

1.07  Tue Feb 17 13:40:00 2015
	- Update pre-reqs.
	- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.
	- Shrink line widths in this file, and in the docs, to 100 chars max.
	- Move t/pod.t to xt/author/.

1.06  Thu Nov  8 12:38:00 2012
	- No code changes.
	- For pre-reqs such as strict, warnings, etc, which ship with Perl, set the version # to 0.
		Reported as RT#80663 by Father Chrysostomos for Tree::DAG_Node.

1.05  Wed Mar 16 11:52:00 2011
	- No code changes. No need to upgrade.
	- Add scripts/create.table.pl, to make it easy to create the 'trees' table.
	- Run with -h to get help, especially regarding $DBI_DSN, $DBI_USER, $DBI_PASS.
	- Run with -dsn, -extra_columns, -password, -table_name and -username to use another options.
	- Add Tree::DAG_Node::Persist::Create for use by scripts/create.table.pl and t/test.t.
	- Note: Both these programs default to using the same 3 env vars. However, for t/test.t, if
		$DBI_DSN is empty, it uses File::Temp and a DSN of dbi:SQLite:dbname=$temp_file_name.

1.04  Tue Feb 15 15:07:00 2011
	- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
	- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.

1.03  Mon Oct 25 11:14:00 2010
	  - Extend write() method to accept an optional arrayref of extra fields to be written to the
		db. The field names are in the call to write(), and the field values are taken from the
		attributes of the node.
	  - Note: The field 'id' is automatically written to the db, when write() is called, so
	  	there is no need to include it in the arrayref.
	  - Extend read() method likewise to recover this extra data.
	  - Note: The field 'id' is automatically put in the node's attributes, when read() is called,
		so there is no need to include it in the arrayref.
	  - Enhance t/test.t to match. See usage of $extra, and where $target = 1011.
	  - Add README to MANIFEST.

1.02  Thu Oct  7 10:01:00 2010
	  - Add README file.
	  - Change attrs for DBI -> connect in t/test.t, to {RaiseError => 1, PrintError => 1,
			AutoCommit => 1}.

1.01  Thu Oct  7  8:57:00 2010
	  - Add EXLOCK => 0 to the options used by File::Temp in t/test.t. Thanx to Slaven Rezic for
		help with this.
	  - Clarify discussion of id field in attributes hash. Detail: Mention that nodes have ids only
		after being written to the database and read back in, so that people don't think the module
		generates ids.
	  - Add a new section to the POD: Machine-Readable Change Log, as part of my new policy to
		promote Module::Metadata::Changes.
	  - Add print statements to Build.PL and Makefile.PL explaining the usage of env vars to
		influence t/test.t, if you don't want the default behaviour of using DBD::SQLite. This is
		already noted in the FAQ.

1.00  Tue Oct  5 11:00:00 2010
	  - Original version.
