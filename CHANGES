Revision history for Perl extension Tree:DAG_Node::Persist.

1.03  Mon Oct 25 11:14:00 2010
	  - Extend write() method to accept an optional arrayref of extra fields to be written to the db.
	  	The field names are in the call to write(), and the field values are taken from the attributes
		of the node.
	  - Note: The field 'id' is automatically written to the db, when write() is called, so
	  	there is no need to include it in the arrayref.
	  - Extend read() method likewise to recover this extra data.
	  - Note: The field 'id' is automatically put in the node's attributes, when read() is called, so
	  	there is no need to include it in the arrayref.
	  - Enhance t/test.t to match. See usage of $extra, and where $target = 1011.
	  - Add README to MANIFEST.

1.02  Thu Oct  7 10:01:00 2010
	  - Add README file.
	  - Change attrs for DBI -> connect in t/test.t, to {RaiseError => 1, PrintError => 1, AutoCommit => 1}.

1.01  Thu Oct  7  8:57:00 2010
	  - Add EXLOCK => 0 to the options used by File::Temp in t/test.t. Thanx to Slaven Rezic for help with this.
	  - Clarify discussion of id field in attributes hash. Detail: Mention that nodes have ids only after
	  	being written to the database and read back in, so that people don't think the module generates ids.
	  - Add a new section to the POD: Machine-Readable Change Log, as part of my new policy to promote
	  	Module::Metadata::Changes.
	  - Add print statements to Build.PL and Makefile.PL explaining the usage of env vars to influence
	  	t/test.t, if you don't want the default behaviour of using DBD::SQLite. This is already noted in the FAQ.

1.00  Tue Oct  5 11:00:00 2010
